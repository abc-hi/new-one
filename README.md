"# new-one" 
"# new-one" 

This repository is created for giving demo on Git and GitHub.

Things I did to create this repository.
 
 + Created an empty repository named `new-one` in [GitHub](https://github.com/new).
 + Copied the contents from the page from the repository under titled `creating new repositoryon the command line` and the 
lines are
``` 
echo "# new-one" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/abc-hi/new-one.git
git push -u origin main 
```
 + I have crated an empty folder in my file explorer and opened the file in CMD. After opened CMD
   I just copy pasted and excuted the lines one by one.

  + This first line `echo "# new-one" >> README.md` created an README.md file with the content `"# new-one"`.
